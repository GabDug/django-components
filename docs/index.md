## Summary

It lets you create "template components", that contains both the template, the Javascript and the CSS needed to generate the front end code you need for a modern app. Use components like this:

```htmldjango
{% component "calendar" date="2015-06-19" %}{% endcomponent %}
```

And this is what gets rendered (plus the CSS and Javascript you've specified):

```html
<div class="calendar-component">Today's date is <span>2015-06-19</span></div>
```

Read our [user guide](user_guide/index.md) to set it up and learn about the details!
